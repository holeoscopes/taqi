        <h1>Lunar Eclipse</h1>
        <p>A lunar eclipse occurs when the Moon moves into the Earth's shadow.
           This can occur only when the Sun, Earth, and Moon are exactly or very closely aligned (in syzygy)
           with Earth between the other two, and only on the night of a full moon. The type and length of a
           lunar eclipse depend on the Moon's proximity to either node of its orbit.</p>

        <h1>Milky Way</h1>
        <p>The Milky Way is the galaxy that contains our Solar System, with the name describing the galaxy's appearance from Earth: a hazy
          band of light seen in the night sky formed from stars that cannot be individually distinguished by the naked eye</p>

        <h1>Saturnus Planet</h1>
        <p>Saturn is the sixth planet from the Sun and the second-largest in the Solar System, after Jupiter.
          It is a gas giant with an average radius of about nine times that of Earth.
          It only has one-eighth the average density of Earth; however, with its larger volume, Saturn is over 95 times more massive.</p>
